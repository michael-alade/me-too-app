<p> The majority of women in the U.S. have faced some form of sexual harassment at work.  We are part of a coding team which reflects the kind of intersectionality key to the struggles for social justice in our country today.  Mindful of rampant sexual abuse and harassment within our industry, we want to provide technical tools for social change.  We've developed the me2 app in support of the Me Too initiative of Tarana Burke and the organization which she founded in 2007, and the recent waves of #Me Too pronouncements in 2017 which help propel the movement forward.  
</p>
<p>
The purpose of the me2 app is to make immediate recognition and affirmation possible through button-click access to forums and helpful resources for women who feel alone while they experience sexual harassment and abuse and in our ongoing struggless to resist, heal and empower ourselves and our children.
